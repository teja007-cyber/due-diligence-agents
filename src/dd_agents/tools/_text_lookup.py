"""Shared text-file lookup for MCP document tools.

The extraction pipeline names output files using ``_safe_text_name(str(filepath))``
where ``filepath`` is the **absolute** path.  Chat tools receive a **relative**
``source_path`` from the agent.  When the absolute path exceeds 200 UTF-8 bytes
(common with OneDrive / deep directory trees), the filename includes a SHA-256
hash suffix that the relative path alone cannot reproduce.

This module provides ``resolve_text_path`` which tries multiple path forms so
that document tools work regardless of how the agent references the file.

    Tries, in order:
    1. ``_safe_text_name(source_path)``  — works when agent uses the same
       path form as extraction (e.g. both relative, or both absolute).
    2. ``_safe_text_name(absolute_path)`` — where *absolute_path* is
       ``data_room_path / source_path`` resolved.  Matches files produced
       by the pipeline (which always passes absolute paths).
    3. Glob fallback — scans ``text_dir`` for any ``.md`` file whose name
       contains the source file's stem.  Handles edge cases where neither
       form matches exactly (e.g. the file was extracted with a slightly
       different relative prefix).

    Returns the first matching ``Path``, or ``None`` if nothing found.
